The user likely wants the project to connect to and function with the latest, officially supported MCP server setup.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The user wants to update their project to use the official GitHub MCP server.\n- This involves configuring the server, generating a personal access token (PAT), and establishing the connection.\n- The official MCP server enables AI tools and projects to interact directly with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Identify Required Changes:**\n   - Review the current project configuration to see how it connects to MCP servers.\n   - Determine what needs to be updated or replaced to point to the official GitHub MCP server.\n\n2. **Setup the Official MCP Server:**\n   - Follow official documentation to set up the MCP server either locally or remotely.\n   - Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions (repos, issues, pull requests, etc.).\n\n3. **Configure the Project:**\n   - Update environment variables or configuration files to include the new MCP server URL and the PAT.\n   - Ensure the server is accessible and correctly integrated with the project.\n\n4. **Test the Integration:**\n   - Run the project and verify that it can successfully connect and perform actions with the MCP server.\n   - Debug any connection or authorization issues.\n\n5. **Document the Changes:**\n   - Record the new setup steps and configurations.\n   - Update the project documentation for future users or collaborators.\n\n6. **Create a Pull Request / Commit Update:**\n   - Commit the changes and open a PR for review.\n   - Confirm the project functions as expected with the official MCP server.\n\n7. **Close the Issue:**\n   - Once verified, mark the issue as resolved and update the issue description with the update details.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n- [GitHub - github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) : Official MCP server repository.\n- [Setting Up the GitHub MCP Server - by Suraj Anand](https://surajanand.substack.com/p/setting-up-the-github-mcp-server): Step-by-step setup guide.\n- [GitHub Documentation on Using MCP Server](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/context/model-context-protocol/using-the-github-mcp-server)\n\nThis plan should guide you through properly updating your project to use the official MCP server.", "type": "TextMessage"}, {"source": "reasoner", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 754, "completion_tokens": 200}, "metadata": {}, "created_at": "2025-06-30 10:38:19.709645+00:00", "content": "Draft comment:\n\nThanks for opening this issue. Based on the research, the main root causes are likely related to the project's current configuration not pointing to the official GitHub MCP server or lacking proper setup for authentication.\n\n**Potential root causes:**\n- The project may be configured to connect to an outdated or unofficial MCP server.\n- Missing or misconfigured environment variables or credentials (e.g., PAT) needed for the official server.\n- Lack of updated setup instructions or documentation guiding the switch.\n\n**Next steps:**\n1. Review current project configuration to identify MCP server URLs and authentication methods.\n2. Follow official documentation to set up the GitHub MCP server and generate necessary credentials.\n3. Update environment variables/config files with the new server URL and PAT.\n4. Test connectivity and functionality with the official server.\n5. Document the setup process and any changes made.\n6.
